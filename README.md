# fancontrol
Written (poorly) in python, currently a WIP

Inspired by https://github.com/sulaweyo/r710-fan-control
But i wanted something that isn't ruby, and can handle multiple kinds of BMCs, currently iDRAC 6 and Lenovo/IBM X6 X3850

## Planned features
* Detect which BMC we're talking to
* Handle errors and exceptions well and leave the BMC on the automatic fan profile if something goes wrong
* Be easily containerised
* ???
* profit
